Setup

Our group used Java in conjunction with MySQL for this project. We used Java SE 14.0 and MySQL version 8.0.21 with the MySQL Community Edition Server. We also used Eclipse IDE to run the program. Firstly, you will need to unzip the JavaDB.zip folder. Then you are able to import the project into the Eclipse by right-clicking the project explorer and click import. Under the "general" folder, select "Project from Folder or Archive" and select the JavaDB folder wheverever you unzipped it. You will also need to open MySQL and create a new schema with any name you want and set it to default schema. In the Driver.java class, you will need to scroll down and edit the getConnection() method and change "test", "root", and "1234" with the name of the schema you created, the username for MySQL, and the password for MySQL. You can now run the program.
